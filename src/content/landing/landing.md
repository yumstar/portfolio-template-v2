Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a fresh computer science graduate of York University. I've refined my soft and technical skills at the **Ministry of Transportation** in Ontario doing database and full-stack work. As a person, I'm just curious in just about everything and always pursuing something for something new to learn. Currently, I'm drawn to  *software development* and *data science*, but I'm always reading up about topics from fields like Linguistics to Law to Astronomy. I'm always open to connect with new people, so please do reach out for a chat!
