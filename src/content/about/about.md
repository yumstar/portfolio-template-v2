Hi,  I work as a *Software Engineer*  based out of Toronto, Canada.

I love seeing what makes things work and conversely, what makes them not. I approach each project I take on in a multidisciplinary manner but as of now, and you could say the **back-end** and **cloud** realms are my 🏘️! With my background working in teams of all perfect sizes, my practical sense and people-focus assist me in delivering great solutions and products that clients love and find easy to use.
