Hi,  I'm a _Software Engineer_  based out of Toronto, Canada.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various *UX design* & *research methods* as well as *frontend*, *backend*, *database* and *cloud technologies*. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences.  I primarily code in **Python** and **Typescript**, and use **Adobe XD** and **Illustrator** for designing.
