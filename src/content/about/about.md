Hi,  I'm a _Software Engineer_  based out of Toronto, Canada.

I love seeing what makes things work and conversely, what makes them not. I approach each project I take on in a multidisciplinary manner and have become confident in *frontend*, *backend*, *data science* or just *data* in general. With my background working in small and large teams, my business sense and people-focus assist me in delivering great solutions and products that clients love and find easy to use.
